### Why Did I use IPFS?

I wanted to use IPFS to design a simple and fun app where everyone can collaborate, learn about NFTs and experience them directly.

### How it's made?

NFT Birthday Cards application makes use of the following software:

NFTStorage: the data is stored on NFTStorage IPFS, the generated hash (CID) will be used to view the details and to retrieve the NFT.

- ​​ NFTPort for multi-chain NFT minting, and data transparency such as distributing rewards and minting the NFT.

- Unlock for giving the user access to exclusive content
